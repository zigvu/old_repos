    "body": "#### Usage\r\n\r\nDynamic loading of data is useful in following scenarios in the analytics page:\r\n\r\n1. During initial page load, as soon as the most coarse season data arrives, we can render charts and load higher resolution data as it arrives.\r\n2. When a new game is clicked after filtering in `season` mode, the most coarse resolution of game data can be ajaxed and the game immediately displayed. As the higher resolution data arrives, it can be dynamically added to the crossfilter data structure.\r\n3. When a new set of brand group is selected, instead of refreshing page, we can replace crossfilter data on the fly. This will make analytics truly a one-page application.\r\n\r\n#### Unknowns and issues\r\n\r\n1. If client data connect is slow, higher resolution data will be slow in coming. If user zooms in on the chart, we cannot display higher resolution data until new data arrives. Since the arrival of new data is inderminate, it will create confusion for the user. [Possible solution: Embed an unobtrusive spinner in the chart to let the user know that more data is being fetched.]\r\n2. If the client clicks on one game and immediately clicks on another game, then two ajax requests are dispatched. The request might come in different order - creating a race condition on which game data to display. Furthermore, because two ajax requests are created/processed, the speed of new data display is reduced. [Possible solution: Queue ajax requests such that a new one is not set out prior to receiving data of the old one.]\r\n\r\n#### Implementation notes:\r\n\r\n1. Test crossfilter dynamic data adding\r\n\r\n2. Refactor `ChartManager.displayChart` and `ChartManager.loadGame` functions so that loading data and displaying charts are independent of each other. Have three functions:\r\n\r\n\tchartManager.loadGame\r\n\tchartManager.loadSeason\r\n\tchartManager.displayChart\r\n\r\n3. Change API call to indicate which resolution of data needs to be sent. Have the current API that sends all data in one package as a fall-back solution. If `params[States::SummaryResolutions.*]` is present, send data for only that part.\r\n\r\n4. Make `ChartManager` aware of different resolution of data - inform user that a higher resolution data is available and is being currently being downloaded.\r\n\r\n5. Make `DataParser` lighter weight - if we are sending a lot of individual packets then current duplication of data across packets will be a big overhead."
