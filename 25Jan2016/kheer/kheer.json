    "body": "#### Motivation\r\n\r\nThis issue introduces a few new mining modalities to allow different types of mining to be done in videos:\r\n\r\n* ZdistFinder: See all localization of select detectables at particular zdist values. This type does NOT filter based on spatial intersection - instead choosing to show those intersections as visual feature in the timeline graph. This is the most-basic type of filtering and shows the maximum amount of data. This is useful for FP and FN mining but not so much for cross-class confusions.\r\n\r\n* ChiaVersionComparer: Compare performance of one or more detectables at selected zdists, across chia versions. Such analysis might give us an early indication of whether the model is getting better for that detectable (e.g., if reducing zdist slightly doesn't significantly change output bboxes across chia versions, then we can assume the model has gotten better.)\r\n\r\n* ZdistDifferencer: See all localizations for a detectable that appears in one zdist but not in another (higher) zdist. This is useful for FN mining since a detectable that is seen at zdist `0` but not in zdist `4` for example, is a good FN example. However, at present, due to presence of large cross-class confusion, this modality is not very effective for FN mining.\r\n\r\n* ConfusionFinder: See all localizations where two detectable \"confuse\" with each other at some zdist, scale and intersection threshold. Confusion is determined by the amount of intersection - an intersection of 0 means that the bbox of detectables doesn't touch each other and an overlap of 1 means the bbox completely overlap for at least one detectable involved. This tool is useful for cross-class mining and figuring out which detectable is performing acceptably at what zdist.\r\n"

    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nEach game currently has ~300K localization bboxes (across 3 zdist values) and ~200 clips. After each model iteration, we could evaluate 8 games to mine FP patches. That would give us a total of ~2.5M localization bboxes and 16K clips. Presumably, from a re-training point of view, not all localization bboxes are valuable. If we assume a ranking function (tracked by issue #12) that can rank frames of all these 16K clips, then we could aggregate the frame-level rank to clip-level rank. \r\n\r\nOnce we have ranked clips, we will need mechanism to rotate them in the UI as user mines for more FP patches. Within a clip, we will also need to navigate based on frame rank.\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks the addition of rank based navigation to kheer. To enable user to also navigate based on time, that functionality will also be available based on initial filter selection. Until issue #12 is available, we will simulate frame ranking by the highest zdist score of any class in that frame. \r\n\r\n### New workflow\r\n\r\n* User: Establish a \"mining session\"\r\n* User: Select chia version, classes and videos (based on meta-data)\r\n* System: Run large query to rank all frames within selected videos. Based on frame ranks, rank clips. Group clips into \"sets\" of 5 clips each.\r\n* System: Send the first set to user\r\n* User: Hit \"f\" for the next highest ranking frame within the clip\r\n* System: After all (or at most 50) highest ranking frame of a clip has been mined, go to next clip\r\n* System: Track each user activity/inactivity per frame - assume unlimited bandwidth and storage and store all user activity\r\n"

One way to solve is embed frame number in each frame of video and parse that in javascript to augment the time-based frame-counting.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements:\r\n* Use least amount of pixel area\r\n* Should work in all encoding scheme even when compression of frames is high\r\n\r\n#### Implementation:\r\n* During clip creation from video, embed multi-pixel square boxes in fixed location in frame. Color and position of the square box denotes the frame number\r\n* In JavaScript, once the frame is rendered to canvas, look at average color values of each square box and infer frame number\r\n* Overlay this frame number (and that gotten using time stamp) in a separate layer in the canvas area"
